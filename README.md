## el_neural_plot

### What is this?
This code shows how to plot different types of neural data, using the example of a ~20s long recording from the rat dorsal CA1 hippocampal field.

### HOW TO:
1. Download / clone this repository
2. In Matlab, navigate to the repository and open `see_neural_plot` - no changes to path required
3. Change options if you'd like
4. Run `see_neural_plot` (F5 / Run)
5. Questions or comments are welcome: ask me on Twitter @ElDuvelle

### Disclaimer:
- the code may not work (especially in Matlab versions < 2022b)

### Output:

You should see this (may slightly vary depending on options chosen):
